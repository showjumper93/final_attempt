Annabel Lee Tavern is a little Tavern located a bit off the beaten path in the Canton area of Baltimore City. It is here that we hope that our guests feel at home. We always offer friendly service and affordable cuisine. Our food is what we like to call, &lsquo;upscale comfort&rsquo;. Out menu is eclectic but not pretentious. In addition to our menu we will always have at least six daily specials to choose from and a good dose of vegetarian options. Our wine and beer lists are varied but not pricey.

We, on a daily basis, celebrate Edgar Allen Poe, Baltimore and Maryland. We have a lot of pride in our home, town and state. It is here that a couple can come for a romantic dinner for two. In a nut shell, this is one place that the guests can watch an O&rsquo;s game by romantic candle light.

Everyday we strive to be the best corner tavern in the city.

The Papermoon Diner offers an eccentric, eclectic, technicolor dining experience that might be best described as “comfort food meets Baltimore with a twist.” We're vegetarian and raging-carnivore friendly, with a jam-packed menu featuring everything from meat loaf to crab quesadillas, from vegan nachos to homemade chili to shrimp and grits—and so much more. (Seriously—we didn't even get started on our dessert menu.) 

So whether it's midnight or brunch-ish time, whether you've got a yearn for late-night breakfast or a midday Hella Portabella sandwich with sweet potato fries, stop on by.

We&rsquo;ve been here on this cozy corner of Milton and Eastern Aves. since 2001, and locally owned and operated ince 2006. Our coffee is organic and fair-trade, and is posted for us by a small, independent roaster, and our pastries made by hand right here in Baltimore, because its important to us to show our support for all the other little guys who work and keep the bar high.

We make all of our drinks and sandwiches to order, and bag your beans up fresh, seven days a week. So stop in, relax an enjoy life and your coffee. We love ya, and really appreciate your business!

# Red Emma's Bookstore Coffeehouse
30 W North Ave, Baltimore, MD 21201

Red Emma's is the worker cooperative behind the restaurant, coffee roaster, bookstore, and community events space at 30 W. North Avenue, dedicated to putting principles of solidarity and sustainability into practice in a democratic workplace.

Our project started in 2004, rising from the ashes of Black Planet Books, a volunteer-run anarchist collective bookstore in Fells Point. In building a cafe component in the new space, we wanted to both establish a firmer financial foundation to keep the new project afloat, but also to create a more welcoming environment. There’s no point, after all, in a space dedicated to spreading radical information if the only people who ever come in are already radicalized!

Baltimore in 2004 was a very different place then it is today. When we started, radical, self-managed collective spaces were few and far between. While there were many amazing activists, radical artists, and politically engaged thinkers and writers in the city, there was no place to bring them together to spark encounters and conversations. If Baltimore today has a stronger network of social justice movements, and a rapidly proliferating movement of collectively run spaces and businesses, we’d like to think that our project has had some small part in making that happen.

Our mission is twofold: first, to demonstrate, concretely, that it’s possible to build institutions that directly put values like sustainability and democracy to work, and second, in doing so, to build a resource for movements for social justice here in Baltimore.

In a tiny brick house on Baltimore’s North Amity Street in 1833-1835 Edgar Allan Poe wrote some of the early stories that would make him the father of the modern short story, and create and define the modern genres of mystery, horror and science fiction.

His spirit and legacy live throughout Baltimore City, inspiring authors, poets, playwrights, businesses – and even our sports teams. Poe Baltimore celebrates this legacy.

Poe Baltimore was created to fund, maintain and interpret The Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum, and to celebrate the legacy of one of Baltimore’s most famous residents.  We are dedicated to maintaining the museum as a vibrant experience for the thousands of visitors who come from around the world each year, and as part of a broader mission of city-wide events and educational opportunities.

Poe Baltimore is committed to enriching the experience of visitors to Baltimore, who come to witness the city that inspired Edgar Allan Poe and his intellectual and literary heirs. We are committed to protecting, preserving and celebrating the rich history of the city, the house, and the legacy of one of our most beloved denizens.

# Enoch Pratt Free Library

The Enoch Pratt Free Library is the free public library system of the City of Baltimore, Maryland. Its Central Library is located at 400 Cathedral Street and occupies the northeastern three-quarters of a city block bounded by West Franklin Street to the north, Cathedral Street to the east, West Mulberry Street to the south and Park Avenue to the west. Located on historic Cathedral Hill, north of the downtown business district, the library is also in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal neighborhood and cultural/historic district. The Cathedral Street Main Library is the flagship of the entire Enoch Pratt Free Library system, now with twenty-two community and regional branches, it was designated the "Maryland State Library Resource Center" by the General Assembly of Maryland in 1971.[1][2]

Its establishment began on January 21, 1882 when long-time local hardware merchant, banking and steamship company executive (but born and raised in Massachusetts) and philanthropist Enoch Pratt, (1808-1896), offered a gift of a central library, four branch libraries (with two additional shortly thereafter), and a financial endowment of US $1,058,333 in a significant piece of correspondence to Mayor William Pinkney Whyte and the City Council of Baltimore. His intention was to establish a public circulating library that (as he described it): "shall be for all, rich and poor without distinction of race or color, who, when properly accredited, can take out the books if they will handle them carefully and return them." The grant was accepted by the municipal government and approved by the voters later that year in an election on October 25.[1]
